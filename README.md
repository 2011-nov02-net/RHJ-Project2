# Pokemon Card Auctioneer

## Project Description

A web application that allows users to purchase card packs, trade individual cards with other users, or put cards up for auction. Users will buy packs of cards, which will populate their inventory with individual cards. Each card will have a value based on ratings and rarity. Users can view their collection and choose actions for individual cards such as: auction, trade, rate, sell, etc. . When users put a card up for auction any other user may bid on it or buy out the auction until the time limit expires. Card trading is initiated by one user and confirmed or negotiated by the recipient.
